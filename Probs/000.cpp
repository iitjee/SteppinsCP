Graph Theory:

GrafixMask: See sol, 
( - The sol is based on BFS. (this can be clearly seem by observing 'head' => 'q[head]'
  - uses head&tail as another way of looking at stack
  - q[tail++]=y*1000+x it seems like some row-major order but 1000 is taken just so that it's >400, 600 and it can be parsed into x and y later. Fancy way of storing
  - 
  - DFS using nodes (ctrlF for 'grafix' http://se7so.blogspot.in/2012/04/problem-solving-techniques-example_19.html )
