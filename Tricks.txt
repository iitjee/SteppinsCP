//Left-Rotate an array(n) by d-digits
reverse(vect.begin(), vect.begin()+d);
reverse(vect.begin()+d, vect.end());

/* cool right! :) */

For dynamic arrays, best use vectors! :/


Loop in C-string:
  char s[100];
  for (int i = 0; s[i]; ++i) { ... }
This is extremely useful (also avoids the strlen usage, that you could forget is O(n) and put on for condition).

Testing if not negative 1:
  if (~x) { ... }
This works because negative numbers use two’s complement, so -1 is represented as all ones in binary. The tilde (~) operation inverts all bits of the variable, so the -1 turns into a zero, and any other number turns into something not zero. 


Least significant 1 bit
    int lsb = x&-x;
This is a very useful operation than returns the LSB (EDIT: the least significant bit with value 1) of a number. If you’re used to Fenwick Tree (aka Binary Indexed Tree, or just BIT) then you know how useful it is.


More than one operation per line
    if (dist[v] > dist[u] + w)
	    dist[v] = dist[u] + w, q.push(v);
Many people don’t know this, but you can have statements split by commas. This I tend to use in every problem I solve, it reduces the code and avoids the use of semicolons.
The only down side is that you can’t use with break, continue or return (not statements :/). So when I have to use any of these I have to add braces and semicolons.

Order array without losing original order
    int a[100], p[100];
    // receive input
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) scanf("%d", &a[i]), p[i] = i;

    sort(p, p+n, [=](int i, int j) { return a[i] < a[j]; });
This is extremely useful!

Infinite
    const int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;

This infinite constant is very useful too. I used to do something like x = 2e9; but I had to take care about not adding 
infinites (because of integer overflow) and stuff like this. This constant can be doubled without overflowing and also can be 
set very easily this way:
    int dist[1000];
    memset(dist, 63, sizeof(dist)); // 0x3f == 63
For shortest path algorithms I always use this (I used to tend -1 version, but I had to do additional checks to verify if dist == -1 and if not..) and in CP BFS and SSSP are very common problems.





to swap in-place
		void swap(int *a, int *b)
		{
		    int temp = *a;
		    *a = *b;
		    *b = temp;
		}
//especially used when you want to swap two array elements in-place




given an array of n-numbers, one number is missing. What's that?
- one way is to find the sum of all n-numbers and given n-1 numbers, and then subtract. 
(to avoid overflows you can subtract one number from first array with one number from second array)
- other way is 
	. first xor all the n numbers ->xor1
	. next xor all the n-1 numbers ->xor2
	. the missing numbers is xor of xor1 and xor2! ;)
