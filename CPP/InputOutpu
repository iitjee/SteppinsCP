/*  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0) */
Now cin will be as fast as scanf.
You can't use printf/scanf once you write ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0)
ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0) will de-synchronize cin from scanf and cout from printf. 
This is fine and will result in a speedup if you just use cin and cout, but if you mix that with stdio-style IO, 
then weird things happen.

/* cin.tie(0) */
by default, cout is flushed before each input operation on cin:
cin.tie(0) turns this off by instead "tying" cin to nothing.
Presumably this is done for performance reasons. It would make a significant difference in programs that interweave numerous cin/cout calls, such as those that answer a large number of queries from the input in an online manner.
