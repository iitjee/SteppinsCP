/*

Ordering : FIFO

Basic operations:
 - Enqueue:     Adding an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.
 - Dequeue:     Removing an item from the queue in FIFO. If the queue is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.
 - Front(head): Get the front item from queue.
 - Rear(tail):  Get the last item from queue.

"QUEUE IS USED WHEN THINGS DON’T HAVE TO BE PROCESSED IMMEDIATLY"
eg: - BFS
    - Priority Queues
    - When a resource is shared among multiple consumers. Examples include CPU scheduling, Disk Scheduling.
    - When data is transferred asynchronously (data not necessarily received at same rate as sent) between two processes. Examples include IO Buffers, pipes, file IO, etc.
